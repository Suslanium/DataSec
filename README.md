⚠️EOL - this project is scrapped. I created this project almost 2 years ago(2021), and now I see how bad it actually was in terms of implementation. Very long functions, lots of unreadable code, business logic inside ui, spaghetti code and even duplicated code are only some of the problems. And I'm not even talking about stuff like lack of any proper architecture, for example. And please - don't look at this project's code if you don't want to bleach your eyes. Maybe I will recreate this project from the ground up, but it will not be anytime soon for sure.
